## Description

Visualization of continuous and discrete signals in time domain and frequency domain. Fourier transform is used to convert the time domain to frequency domain. A noise with a normal distribution is added to the clean signal and visualized in a single plot. Finally, two kernels of size 3 and size 11 is used to filter the noisy signal and visualized the results of using each kernel on the noisy signal.

The final output of the above said operations: 

1) Continuous signal in time domain
